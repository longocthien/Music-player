# Music Player Website

This is the official website of the Music Player, a web application that allows users to listen to their favorite songs online. The website provides a user-friendly interface for managing playlists, browsing songs, and enjoying a seamless music playback experience.

## Features

- **Song Playback:** Users can play, pause, skip, and control the volume of the songs. The website supports various audio formats and ensures a smooth and uninterrupted playback experience.

- **Remember User Information:** The website utilizes the localStorage feature to remember user information. When the user interacts with the music player, the application saves information about the volume, the currently playing song, the progress of the song, whether shuffle or repeat is enabled, and other relevant settings. This information is stored locally and persists even when the application is closed. Upon reopening the application, the music player will restore the previous state, allowing users to resume their music playback seamlessly.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. Users can enjoy the music player on their desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.
